# XRP-Price-Trend-Analysis-Prediction-Binance-Data

This project focuses on analyzing Binance trading data for XRP (Ripple) to understand price movements, trading volume patterns, and market behavior throughout 2023.
By combining descriptive statistics, technical indicators (RSI), and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study investigates how legal events‚Äîparticularly SEC litigation‚Äîimpacted XRP‚Äôs volatility and overall market sentiment.

A Linear Regression model was implemented to predict XRP/USD prices, offering insights into correlations between trading variables and XRP‚Äôs performance under regulatory uncertainty.

üìò Overview
The cryptocurrency market is heavily influenced by regulatory news and investor sentiment. This project aims to provide data-driven insights into how such factors affect XRP‚Äôs price dynamics.
Using Binance data, we explored market trends, key fluctuations, and volume-price relationships while addressing unique challenges associated with XRP‚Äôs centralization and ongoing SEC litigation.
